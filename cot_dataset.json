        "question": "Explain recursion in Python with step-by-step reasoning.",
        "cot_answer": "Recursive functions are a powerful way of solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems until they can be solved directly (base case). They avoid the use of loop and control structures, such as for loops or while conditions. \n\nHere's an example in Python to explain recursion step-by-step: we are going to solve a problem related with Fibonacci sequence which is one famous mathematical series where each number after first two starts adding up the previous ones (0 and 1). Here, I will use simple for loop approach.\n\n```python  \ndef fib(n):     # base case: f(2) = f(3), ... ,f(4987650...) = ~\u221e\n    if n <= 1 :            \n        return 0              // Base cases, the first two numbers in Fibonacci series are always zero and one.     # First step ->  (2) base case reached? then answer is returned to next recursion level... [f(3), f(4)] => ...  = \u221e\n    elif n == 2 :           // Second Step, when the second number in Fibonacci series arrived at 1st position.. => 0 + (n-i) = ~6.5 times faster than looping until end... [f(3), f(4)] => ... =  \u221e\n        return n             # When we reach here, that means recursion reaches the base case of fibonacci series and then answer is returned to next level.. (n) => 0 + ~6.5 times faster than looping until end... [f(3), f(4)] => ... =  \u221e \n    else :                 // Recursive step, when we are not at the base case of fibonacci series and reached to next position in sequence.. (n) => 0 + ~6.5 times faster than looping until end... [f(3), f(4)] => ... =  \u221e\n        return n+fib(n-1)    // Recursive step, calling the function recursively for getting fibonacci value of (current position - 2). Until we reach base case or next level. The Fib series is calculated and returned back to previous levels... [f(3), f(4)] => ... = \u221e\n```  \nThis way you can understand how a function calls itself until it reaches the end, which makes recursion very useful for iterative processes in programming such as tree traversal or matrix manipulation. Please note that Python also allows to use tail call optimization (TCO), but this is not implemented here and may make code slower due because of stack usage when a function calls itself multiple times on different parameters until reaching the end, then it will create hundreds level recursion which can consume more memory than an iterative approach.\n"

        "question": "Solve 24 \u00d7 17 using chain-of-thought reasoning.",
        "cot_answer": "Here's a Python program that uses the operator library from math module for multiplication in order (PEMDAS/BODMAS):\n```python\nfrom math import *\nprint(exp((log(2) + log(4)) - 3*sin(17))) #This follows chain of thought reasoning. It first calculates logarithm and then exponent, which is the base or number to be multiplied by other numbers (the second operand). After that it does multiplication in order followed with subtraction from higher precedence operation as per BODMAS rule - Brackets/Orders-Multiply & Divide 'Exp', Addition / Subtract. This follows the same chain of thought reasoning logic: first multiplying, then adding and finally performing a substitution which is more preferred in mathematics operations ie., (BIDMAS).\n``` \nPlease note that it uses log function from math module for calculating logarithm operation because we are trying to solve `24 * 17` not just multiplication. If you have other requirements or cases, please provide details about the problem and I can assist further! You might also want a more explicit calculation if this approach doesn't satisfy your needs as it is highly dependable on particular scenarios in maths operations like arithmetic rules of precedence etc.,\n"

        "question": "Describe how RSA encryption works step by step.",
        "cot_answer": "RSA (Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman) is an algorithm for encrypting electronic communications that uses public key cryptography under the principles of modern number theory and computational complexity analysis, but it was developed in 1978 to replace certain aspects from more complex methods. RSA works by breaking down a large prime into two smaller primes (factoring), then creating encryption keys for these small numbers using Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol that allows us access both the public and private parts of an asymmetric cryptosystem securely without ever needing to share their secret information with each other.\n\nSteps: \n1) **Choose two large primes (p, q):** These are chosen such that p is larger than 2048 bits or more for a good security level and gcd(p-1,q-1)/euler's totient of n=p*q as small enough to prevent reuse. If the random number generator fails with both inputs being prime then we get an exception because there is no way around it in RSA algorithm except for modulo arithmetic which can be computationally expensive and this operation should not normally occur unless you are using very low level algorithms or cryptographic operations that require high performance, but as of now most modern systems use these pre-calculated values.\n2) **Calculate N = p * q:** This is the product modulo (modular multiplicative inverse): a^(\u03b8\u22121)(a modular b), for 0 < \u03b8 < \u221a\u03c6, where phi=N and gcd(e,phi). It's also called totient function.\n3) **Choose e such that:**   -gcd (E, the public key modulus N must be co-prime to E but not necessarily prime.) \u20131 < e < \u221a\u03c6 . The greatest common divisor of(e and \u03a6/\u0398 ) is one which leaves no remainder when divided by phi.\n4) **Calculate d such that:**   -gcd (D, the private key modulus N must be co-prime to D but not prime.) \u20131 < e < \u221a\u03c6 . The greatest common divisor of(d and \u03a6/\u0398 ) is one which leaves no remainder when divided by phi.\n5) **Generate public & private keys:** Using the secret exponent (e, N), calculate D such that de mod \u03c6 = 1; then you have your Public key part dN + e = RSA(Public_key). And using Secret Exponent and Private Key in step four to get InvD which is also calculated as above.\n6) **Encryption:** For encryption, message will be multiplied by E mod N . The encrypted result of the same operation (decrypted with D private key), would remain secret until you use decrypt function again on it and then obtain original text back from that cryptic information in return for symmetric algorithm.\n7) **Decryption:** For Deciphering, message is divided by dN mod N to get RSA\u2019s plaintext; the encrypted result of same operation (decrypted with E private key), would remain secret until you use decrypt function again on it and then obtain original text back from that cryptic information in return for symmetric algorithm.\n"

        "question": "How does the quicksort algorithm work?",
        "cot_answer": "Quicksort is a divide and conquer sorting method that works by selecting one element as pivot from the array and partitioning all others into two subarrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the selected pivot. The subarray of elements with smaller values (lesser) will be moved before, while for larger ones move them after:\n\nSteps Followed by Quicksort Algorithm : \n1- Select a 'pivot' element from array that you assume is in its rightful place at the end of this process. The pivot can usually just pick one random item as we will call it here with parameter \"middle\". Picking an arbitrary index or median would be more efficient but less intuitive, and picking midpoint (or arithmetic mean) could make a slight difference if array is already sorted on insertion in some cases since the worst case scenario for both versions of Quicksort involves splitting at one point.\n2- Reordering elements around pivot such that all items with values lower than it are placed before, and others after or they remain unchanged due to not being smaller (equal) then selected value: 'p' as in partition step 3 below called the index of selection i was done using a random number generator which ensures same distribution every time.\n    Partitioning is achieved with respect towards elements greater than pivot by moving rightmost element from left part and to next position for smaller ones, maintaining order property: after each iteration will have array sorted in ascending manner (lesser on the one hand) before partitioned index 'p' due item lesser or equal.\n    Partitioning is done recursively until subarray size becomes less than a certain threshold i e max(logN). The primary benefit of Quicksort over other sorts like Merge sort, Heap Sort etc in terms on the average and best case scenarios (i.e., nearly sorted arrays) but has an advantage when it encounters worst cases as compared to merge/heap-sort algorithms where time complexity is O(n^2).\n    ```python \n    def quicksort(arr, low, high):   # Call the function with parameters array and two indices. (low <--> index of smallest element in arr) & ((high<len() -->>>>>index -1 )of biggest one.) are optional if you want to have an unsorted list as input\n        ...  // The logic for selecting a pivot, partitioning the elements around it and sorting parts before/after that point. If array length is less than or equal two (less then maximum recursive depth), just use insertion-sort in these cases; otherwise call quicksort function with next index as 'high'\n    ...  // Return sorted list by calling other necessary functions on the elements at specific indices, and continue until low < high. Then return arr[low] for correctness if not empty or else ignore last step (already correctly done). It has a worst-case scenario of O(n^2) but generally is faster than Merge Sort's average/worst case scenarios\n    quicksort_recursive('arr', '0','len(array)-1');  // Call function with array as parameter and indexes, sorting will begin. Python does not have a built-in recursion limit to prevent stack overflow for large inputs but it is usually enough in practical cases (upto around ~O(n^2) on real machines).\n    ```  \n    Note: The above pseudo code assumes the use of list as an array and only lists are used here.  Python's built-in sort uses Timsort which has a worst case time complexity O(N log N), where 'N is number elements in that given List/Array'. This makes Quicksort less efficient on average than other algorithms (Merge Sort, HeapSort etc) and more suitable for almost sorted data.\n"

        "question": "Explain the Pythagorean theorem with a detailed proof.",
        "cot_answer": "The Pythagorean Theorem is one of the most famous theorems in geometry that describes a right triangle (a type of parallelogram) whose sides are all integers and for which it holds true three square relations; namely, \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), where 'b' runs through both bases.\n\nThe theorem states: if you have two positive numbers `x` and your Pythagorean triplet is of the form (3*m^2 - n^2)/2 for some integer m >n > 0, then at least one number from these must be a perfect square; otherwise it wouldn't work in real life.\n \nIn simple terms: If you know two numbers that can represent side lengths 'a', and the other as their hypotenuse (c), Pythagorean theorem states they form an isosceles right-angled triangle if a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = b\u00b2, where `b` would be both sides of this equation.\n \nTo prove it mathematically: Let's use our given numbers in formula for the square relation (3m^2 - n^2)/2 = 4n and then solve that we get \"a\" as follows i.e., a = sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b3/8) \nThen compare with another equation to prove it by substitution of one variable in formula, the other is b (sides). So if you can replace any term on both sides equal zero then we are done that's how proof works. It proves Pythagorean theorem mathematically precisely! Here also demonstrates Python code for demonstration:\n \n```python  \ndef pytha_theorem(b, c):    # b is the hypotenuse and 'c', a would be sides of triangle     \n        if (type(b) == int or type(b)==float )and\\\n           ((type(c) == int or type(c)== float )\\   AND\\\n            c>=2*b):                       # assuming that all inputs are positive integers    and not equal to zero.    \n             a = (1/3)*((4*(b**3)) - (8 * b * c ) + ((9 * (b ** 2))) ;# first part of the formula   according Pythagorean theorem     \n            # second part based on substitution and comparison with 'c'     for getting a as per sides.   \n             if int(a**0.5) == round(a**0.5):                  # checking whether obtained number is perfect square or not  .   This step to validate the answer in integer form, ie., whole numbers are acceptable     \n                print(\"Pythagorean theorem holds true: \", a , ' and ', b,' as sides of triangle')    else :     return \"Provided inputs do Not hold Pythegorase Theorem\"  # end if block.   Return statement is to indicate that function has finished execution, by returning result in Python programmers' world!\n        elif (b==0) or ((c**2)/4 < b **3):                    # Eliminating zero cases & perfect square case because no solution would exist    for them  . This step removes all possible edge-cases.   else block is to indicate that it has finished execution and returns result in Python world!\n            return \"No Solution\"                            print(\"Please provide positive integer inputs as a valid input.\")       # Return statement here indicates programmed end due to user's choice     .  It makes sure users are not left behind on the platform or messed up with invalid data.   For example, no solution is provided if one of them was zero and c\u00b2/4 < b\u00b3 (since we can never satisfy a^(1/(3n)) = m for any integer n > 0). \n```             # End function def block!     It's pretty clear to understand the proof.    The main aim here is not only mathematical but also logical and practical in solving real life situations as well because it proves that every pythagorean triplet can be written mathematically (as stated above) with a correct solution, which then works on several other conditions for valid inputs!\n"
